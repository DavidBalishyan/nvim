# Neovim Config

My personal Neovim configuration for a fast and productive setup.

## Features

- Preconfigured LSP, autocompletion, and snippets
- File navigation with Telescope and oil.nvim
- Easy commenting, autopairs, and surrounding text
- Clean and minimal UI 

## Installation

```bash
# Backup existing config (optional)
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
# Open neovim
nvim
```
All plugins are managed with lazy.nvim, and they will install automatically on first run.
